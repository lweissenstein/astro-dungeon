## Overview

Astro Dungeon is a 2D endless top-down shooter where you play as a stranded astronaut, fending off waves of alien enemies. Each wave grows progressively harder, requiring players to use both their weapons and power-ups strategically to survive.

Players can aim and shoot in any direction using the mouse, with the gun rotating to match the firing direction. The game includes power-ups, a variety of enemies, and a local highscore system that tracks the player’s best performance.
